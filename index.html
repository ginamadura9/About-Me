  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p> I'm an Operations Manager working for <a href="http://www.coyote.com">Coyote</a>, a logistics start-up based in Chicago. While it was my job that recently led me to the Mile High city, the easy-access to the outdoors and the unbelievable weather have made it an enjoyable place to call home. I'm a huge fan of most outdoor activities (glamping, included), snowboarding, running, yoga & reading.</p>
  <p> I'm excited to learn how to code, as I've always found WebDev interesting (and it's certainly proven challenging!), and I really enjoy seeing the work I create come to fruition.</p>
  <p>Albeit I genuinely enjoy learning, the great outdoors and all of the fun activites that go along with it, by far the most important things to me are my friends, family, and my dog Moose!</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I hail from the Windy City but currently call Denver, CO home.  I've basically been transferring myself between Colorado and Illinois for about ten years now as I graduated high school in IL, attended Colorado State University, lived back in Chicago for four years after college, and have somehow found myself back in Mile High!</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I enjoy hot yoga, running, reading and snowboarding.  I consider myself somewhat of a foodie and enjoy trying new restaurants as much as I can!</p>
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>Well, I'm still in the process of figuring that out! What led me to WebDev is my interest in technology and the web, so I'm trying out coding for fit and will see what it leads to!  The most important aspect for me is finding work that I find challenging and fulfilling.</p> 
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>Given the season, I've been listening to a lot of Michael Buble Christmas music, but have also taken a liking to Miami Horror's latest album, 'All Possible Futures.'</p>
